- 👋 Hi, I’m @santilinares
- 👀 I’m interested in technology in general, but lately i've been really interested in how technology can improve our life as car drivers,
  but the fact is I'm interested in learning all kind of things.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Engineering. I'm in my 2º year and I honestly like it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project that doesn't requires big knowledge, so I can both learn and help.
- 📫 You can reach me via this email... santilinares02@gmail.com
